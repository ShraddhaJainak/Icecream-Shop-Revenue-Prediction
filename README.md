# Project : Icecream Shop Revenue Prediction
This project is made to Predict Revenue of an Ice Cream Shop depending upon the Temperature.<br>
<br>We used Decision Tree Regressor to build a model to find the relation between the two variables.
So we have a dataset of a Ice Cream Shop wherein<br>
<li>"Temperature" is independent variable
<li>"Revenue" is dependent variable
<br>And for better accuracy the project is further extended to build the model using Linear Regression
